This is a CoffeeScript implementation of the single web page appliation found in an excellent book by Michael S. Mikowski and Josh C. Powell. 

The title of their book is: Single Page Web Applications

They developed their app in JavaScript, while the code in this repository is CoffeeScript and JavaScript generated by CoffeeScript.


Just their JavaScript coding standard in appendix A is worth the price of the book.

Although the code in this repository does contain a few comments, to understand how the code works you should really buy the book.

To run the code, you'll have have nodejs, npm, and CoffeeScript installed.

You'll also have to have MongoDB installed as well.

Also, you'll need to install the node_modules by running: 

npm install 

from the command shell.

Then you should be able to start the webserver on port 3000 by running:

coffee app.coffee

in the command shell.

To see the app in action, bring up two browser windows and point them at:
localhost:3000

All of the above is described in detail in the book: Single Page Web Applications

So, if you want to understand how to install this program and how it  works: buy the book.
